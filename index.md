### About me:
I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Vienna, supervised by Prof. [Benjamin Roth](https://www.benjaminroth.net). My research interests are machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). I currently work on weak supervision methods for NLP tasks, especcially sequence labeling. I am also interested in multimodal methods combining text and images.


Previously, I was a research assistant in the [EXTREMUM Project](https://dsv.su.se/en/research/research-areas/datascience/extremum-explainable-and-ethical-machine-learning-for-knowledge-discovery-from-medical-data-sources-1.442728) and member of the [Data Science Group](https://datascience.dsv.su.se/) at Stockholm University, Sweden. I received my M.Sc. degree in Computer Science from Athens University of Economics and Business in 2019. I am a research assistant and member of the [Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/) at Athens University of Economics and Business, Greece.
